Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

This is a challenge involving the use of Express.js to create a Note Taking application that can read data from a database in the back end. When the note taker is opened, I should be presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When the link to the notes page is clicked, I should be presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. When a new note title and the note’s text is entered, then a Save icon should appear in the navigation at the top of the page. When I the save icon is clicked, the newly entered note is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. When an existing note in the list in the left-hand column is clicked, that note should appear in the right-hand column. When the Write icon is clicked in the navigation at the top of the page, I should be presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

Screenshots of the application can be found in the Screenshots folder in the repository.
